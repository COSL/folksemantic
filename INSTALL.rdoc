= Folksemantic setup with Windows specific help

This tutorial explains how to get Folksemantic going on your local Windows machine and deploy it to a Linux server. 
It assumes that you have a technical background, have never developed with Ruby on Rails, and are starting from 
ground zero on your machine.
    
== Install
  This section covers:
  * Command Prompt Here (Only needed for Windows)
  * Ruby (language), Ruby on Rails (web application framework), and Ruby Gems (package manager)
  * Aptana Studio and RadRails (Ruby on Rails Development Environment)
  * MySQL (database)    
  * Git (version control system)
  * Capistrano (deployment tool only needed for Windows)
  * PuTTY (SSH client)
  * Install RMagick
  * Install Gem Dependencies
  
=== Command Prompt (Windows Only)

You are going to be doing a lot of things from the command prompt. Setting up Command Prompt Here[http://www.fileformat.info/tip/microsoft/cmd_prompt_here.htm]
makes it so you can open a command prompt in the directory that you are viewing in Windows Explorer.

   1. Open Windows Explorer
   2. Choose Tools - Folder Options...
   3. Switch to the File Types tab
   4. Select Folder from the list and press the Advanced button.
   5. Choose New
   6. Give it a nice name like "Command Prompt Here" and the application c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /K cd "%1"
   7. OK, OK and OK to save it.

=== Ruby (language), Ruby on Rails (web application framework), and Ruby Gems (package manager)

Ruby[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/] is the flexible and fun programming language from Japan made popular by the productive 
Ruby on Rails[http://rubyonrails.org/] web application framework. Third party Ruby libraries are called Gems. 
Ruby Gems is the standard Ruby package manager, similar to apt-get, emerge, and other OS package managers.

Folksemantic is a web application written on top of the Ruby on Rails framework. Follow these 
instructions on installing Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Ruby Gems[http://rubyonrails.org/download] to get started. 
As of 12/18/2009 the following versions are recommended: 
Ruby 1.8.7-p174 Ruby Source[ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.7-p174.tar.gz] or
Ruby 1.8.6-26 Windows Installer[http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/66871/rubyinstaller-1.8.6-p383-rc1.exe], 
Ruby Gems 1.3.5[http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/60719/rubygems-1.3.5.zip], 
and Ruby on Rails 2.3.5.

   1. Download and run the Ruby 1.8.6-p383 install[http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/66871/rubyinstaller-1.8.6-p383-rc1.exe] or compile from source
      Ruby 1.8.7-p174 Ruby Source[ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.7-p174.tar.gz].
   2. Download and extract Ruby Gems 1.3.5[http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/60719/rubygems-1.3.5.zip], then 
      open a command prompt to the folder you extracted it to and run ruby setup.rb
   3. Install the gemcutter gem.  All ruby gems are now hosted on gemcutter.
      sudo gem install gemcutter
   4. Install Rails
      sudo gem install rails

* Note that on Windows you only need to run 'gem install rails' as sudo is not required on that platform.  
This will be assumed throughout the rest of this document.

=== Setup Development Environment

==== Textmate
Textmate is a commercial editor used by many Ruby on Rails developers. (http://macromates.com/)

==== Ruby Mine
Ruby Mine is an integrated development environment. (http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/index.html)
  
==== Aptana Studio and RadRails (Ruby on Rails Development Environment)
On Windows, the awesome open source Eclipse[http://www.eclipse.org/] IDE is my favorite. 
Aptana[http://www.aptana.com/] has developed a variant of Eclipse (Aptana Studio) and 
Ruby on Rails plugins for Aptana Studio and Eclipse that make things easier. 
Download Aptana Studio[http://www.aptana.com/studio/download/] (117 MB) or go with your favorite editor (please don't say Notepad.

   1. Download and install Aptana Studio 1.2[http://www.aptana.com/studio/download/] (117 MB)
   2. Add the RadRails plugin (34 MB) to Aptana Studio by following the instructions at Help > Open My Aptana > Plugins > Aptana RadRails.
   

=== Install MySQL (Database)

Folksemantic utilizes a database on the back end. Development of Folksemantic has used [MySQL, the world's most popular open source database]
(http://www.mysql.com/), but it should be use other databases such as Postgres. Download and install 
MySQL Community Server edition[http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#win32].

Download and install MySQL Community Server edition (Windows Essentials x86)[http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#win32].

Scroll down and click "No thanks, just take me to the downloads!" if you don't want to register.

I used all of the default options when I installed MySQL except on the page that prompted me to "Please select the default 
character set". Here I chose "Best support for multi-lingualism" (UTF8). If you only ever are going to have English users 
and content, you can stick with "Standard Character Set" (latin1).

I also unchecked the "Modify Security Settings" this leaves the root user's password blank. This is probably ok for your 
development machine because it is also configured to only accept connections from itself (not other machines).

This sets it the MySQL server up to run on port 3306.


=== Install Git (version control system)

Git[http://git.or.cz/] is a version control system like CVS or SVN (but better). Folksemantic developers use it to coordinate work. 
The definitive source for Folksemantic[http://github.com/COSL/folksemantic] is hosted at github[http://github.com/] 
(an awesome free service!).

==== Mac
Follow the guide on github for installing Git on the Mac[http://help.github.com/mac-git-installation/]

==== Windows
Follow Kyle's Cordes instructions on installing Git on Windows[http://kylecordes.com/2008/04/30/git-windows-go/] or the 
shorter description on github[http://github.com/guides/using-git-and-github-for-the-windows-for-newbies] to get started with Git.

Download and run the msysgit installer[http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list] (I tested with 
Git-1.6.0.2-preview20080923.exe[http://msysgit.googlecode.com/files/Git-1.6.0.2-preview20080923.exe)].

I used the default options except on the page titled "Adjusting your PATH environment", I chose run Git and included Unix tools from the command prompt.


=== Install Capistrano (Deployment tool)
Deploying Folksemantic to a Linux server can take an hour or more when done by hand, seconds when done using 
Jamis Buck's Capistrano[http://www.capify.org/]. As stated in the 
Capistrano Download Instructions[http://www.capify.org/download], now that you have Ruby Gems installed, 
downloading and installing Capistrano is as easy as typing:

  sudo gem install capistrano


=== Install PuTTY (SSH Client, Windows only)
The standard way to talk to a Linux box is using SSH[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell]. 
Download and install PuTTY[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html] (a Windows SSH client) 
to prepare to connect. While you are at it, you may want to grab pageant, a utility that will save you from having to retype your ssh password repeatedly.


=== Install ImageMagick
ImageMagick[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php] is a library that Paperclip (file upload gem) uses for image manipulation.
Look on the ImageMagick[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php] website for instructions on how to install for various platforms.

=== Install Gem Dependencies
Copy and paste the following into a command window to install the gems needed to run Folksemantic:
  sudo gem install will_paginate
  sudo gem install jrails
  sudo gem install authlogic
  sudo gem install searchlogic
  sudo gem install bcrypt-ruby
  sudo gem install acts-as-taggable-on
  sudo gem install paperclip
  sudo gem install awesome_nested_set
  sudo gem install friendly_id
  sudo gem install sanitize
  sudo gem install recaptcha
  sudo gem install newrelic_rpm
  sudo gem install feedzirra
  sudo gem install tiny_mce
  sudo gem install geokit
  sudo gem install httparty -v0.4.4
  sudo gem install oauth
  sudo gem install oauth-plugin
  sudo gem install babelphish
  sudo gem install uploader
  sudo gem install muck-engine
  sudo gem install muck-solr
  sudo gem install muck-feedbag
  sudo gem install muck-raker
  sudo gem install muck-services
  sudo gem install muck-users
  sudo gem install muck-activities
  sudo gem install muck-comments
  sudo gem install muck-profiles
  sudo gem install muck-friends
  sudo gem install muck-shares
  sudo gem install muck-contents
  sudo gem install muck-blogs
  sudo gem install muck-invites
  sudo gem install muck-oauth


== Develop
  This section covers:
  * Retrieve Folksemantic from git hub
  * Configure Folksemantic
  * Set up databases for Folksemantic
  * Populate the Folksemantic Database
  * Run Folksemantic on your computer
  * Merge the latest Folksemantic code from the master branch into another branch
  * Run the Folksemantic tests
  * Set up an Aptana Studio project for working on Folksemantic
  * Update translation files
  * Commit changes to a Folksemantic branch ssss
  * Push Folksemantic changes to github

=== Retrieve Folksemantic from github
Now that you have installed all of that fun stuff, it is time to pull down Folksemantic. To do this, open a command prompt, 
go to your root projects folder and use the git clone command:

  git clone git://github.com/COSL/folksemantic.git

That will create a folder called Folksemantic and copy the source code to it. If you want to copy the source to a folder other 
than Folksemantic, just specify the folder name at the end:

  git clone git://github.com/COSL/folksemantic.git Folksemantic2

Now that you have pulled the code down, you just need to install the gems (ruby libraries) that Folksemantic uses, set up 
some configuration files, and set up a database for Folksemantic to use.


=== Configure Folksemantic
Folksemantic utilizes a number of configuration files that you need to set up to get going:

  config/global_config.yml
  config/database.yml

Example files are included with Folksemantic:

  config/global_config.yml.example
  config/database.yml.example

Copy or rename these files, removing '.example' to get going.

If you are setting up a new Folksemantic instance, you will need to obtain various keys to put in the configuration files.  
These keys are documented in config/global_config.yml.example.


=== Set up databases for Folksemantic
The database that Folksemantic uses is specified in the :development section /config/database.yml . You need to create the database:

  rake db:create

Now use rake to load the Folksemantic schema into the database as following:

  rake db:migrate

**Note**: Windows users need to load the win32console gem before using rake to load the Folksemantic schema. 
Use the following syntax to install the win32console-1.2.0-x86-mswin32-60 gem:

  gem install win32console

=== Populate the Folksemantic Database
The Folksemantic application requires a number of default values to run properly.  Run the following rake commands to populate the database:
  rake muck:db:populate
  rake muck:raker:db:populate
  rake muck:raker:db:bootstrap_services

=== Run Folksemantic on your computer
Before you run Folksemantic, you need to start up the solr server that Folksemantic uses to support searching:

**Linux & Mac**: 
  rake solr:start

**Windows**: 
  rake solr:start_win

**Note**: Windows users might run into the following error: **No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it. - connect(2)**. 
To resolve this issue, follow the steps listed on webonrails.com[http://webonrails.com/2007/09/13/acts_as_solr-starting-solr-server-on-windows/].

However, you might have to revert the **Errno::EBADF** to **Errno::ECONNREFUSED** in the modified vendor/plugins/acts_as_solr/lib/taks/solr.rake script for the solr server to start on windows.

Now you should be ready to run Folksemantic on your machine. Start up a local webserver server with the following command:
  
  ruby script/server

If all is not good, you will see error messages. If not, open Folksemantic in your favorite web browser: http://localhost:3000/


=== Merge the latest Folksemantic code from the master branch into another branch
Now that you have the master branch running, you may want to pull down and develop on a different branch. At the command prompt where Folksemantic is running, press Ctrl + C to stop it.

Now pull down the branch from github:

git checkout --track -b <name for local branch> origin/<name of remote branch>

For example:

git checkout --track -b test origin/test

Use git to merge[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html] updates from the master branch into the branch you just checked out:

git merge master

Now try running the updated branch of Folksemantic to make sure all is well:

ruby script/server 


=== Run the Folksemantic tests
Run rake using the following command to load the test schema:

rake db:test:prepare 

Install the following additional gems - these are required for testing:
    
  * gem install factory_girl 
  * gem install zentest
  * gem install shoulda
  * gem install redgreen

To run all of the Folksemantic tests:

  rake test

To run just the unit, functional, or integration tests:

  rake test:units
  rake test:functionals
  rake test:integration

To run a single test script:

  ruby <test script ruby file>

For example:

  ruby test/unit/user_test.rb

Each time you run a test the Rails environment is loaded and a clean database is set up. This takes significant time. To avoid this startup time, you can run the tests continuously using autotest:

  autotest

When running autotest relevant tests are automatically re-run whenever you change a file.

For more information on Rails testing and autotest, and shoulda (the testing framework that Folksemantic uses) see 
A Guide to Testing the Rails[http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/20], Getting started 
with Autotest[http://ph7spot.com/articles/getting_started_with_autotest], and Shoulda testing[http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda].


=== Set up an Aptana Studio project for working on Folksemantic
In order to work on Folksemantic in Aptana Studio, you will want to create a project for it.

   1. Run Aptana
   2. Choose File, Project, New.
   3. Choose Rails Project from the Rails folder.
   4. Uncheck the "Use default location" checkbox.
   5. Specify the path to where you checked out Folksemantic with git (e.g. C:/Documents and Settings/Joel/My 
      Documents/projects/Folksemantic).
   6. Specify a name for your project (e.g. yfh).
   7. Uncheck the "Generate Rails application skeleton", "Create a WEBrick server" and "Create a Mongrel server" 
      options.
   8. Click Finish. 

The project will be set up and its contents will be displayed in the Ruby Explorer on the left side panel.

Note: Aptana Studio comes with powerful recursive search functionality that can help you find things in Folksemantic. 
To use it, select the parent folder of the files you want to search in the Ruby Explorer, and then choose "File" from the "Search" menu.

**Note**: Aptana Studio is very configurable, but by default all files are considered to be ANSI encoded. This means that if you open a 
UTF8 encoded file or file containing special characters (such as Turkish) in it, the characters will not be displayed correctly. 
In Folksemantic, this applies especially to the .yml translation files. To overcome this problem you can edit those files in a 
different editor (such as Notepad), or you can explicitly specify the encoding that Aptana Studio should consider 
the files to be. To change what encoding Aptana Studio should use for a file, right click on the file and choose Properties 
from the context sensitive menu. Then choose the "Other" Text file encoding option and select UTF-8, or another appropriate encoding scheme. 
Close and reopen the file if you already have it open.


=== Update a translation file


=== Commit changes to a Folksemantic branch
In order to deploy updates, first commit your changes to your local repository, and then push them up to github. 
The gui provided with git can be helpful for reviewing and committing changes:

  git gui

Select the changed or added files and click Ctrl + T to stage them for committing. Then type a message describing the commit, 
and click the Commit button. It is a good idea to create commits that group related changes.


=== Push Folksemantic changes to github
After you commit changes to your local repository, you can push those changes up to github so 
they can be pulled down to your production server. If you are still in git gui, do this by clicking the Push button. 

If you prefer using the command line use the following commands:
  
Add all changes so that they can be committed:
  git add . 

Commit changes locally:
  git commit -m "some interesting message describing the changes you made"

Push change to the remote master branch:
  git push


== Deploy to a Linux server
Covered in this section
  * Generate a private / public key pair and copy your public key to the remote server
  * Deploy Folksemantic to the remote server
  * Diagnose and fix problems on the server
  * Restart mongrel
    
=== Generate a private / public key pair and copy your public key to the remote server

Capistrano uses ssh to connect to a linux server to deploy Folksemantic. In order to for this secure connection to occur, 
you need to set create a private / public key pair on your computer and copy the public key up to the remote server.

   1. Go to a command prompt. 


=== Deploy Folksemantic to the remote server
Once Capistrano is set up, deploying Folksemantic is as simple as going to the root of Folksemantic at the MINGW32 command prompt and running:

  cap deploy

Watch the messages it spits out and cross your fingers. Depending on how you have things configured, it may prompt you for the sudo password so it can restart mongrel.

If an error occurs, Capistrano should automatically roll back the deployment and leave you at the state it was in before the deployment was attempted. If you need to manually roll back a deployment:

  cap deploy:rollback

When you run cap deploy, it executes the Capfile script located in the current directory. For Rails projects, this file typically just executes config/deploy.rb script.

To see all tasks available via Capistrano:

  cap -Tv

Capistrano uses the following directory structure on the server to deploy applications:

<containing folder>
<containing folder>/shared
<containing folder>/current (symbolic link)
<containing folder>/current/<project files>
<containing folder>/releases
<containing folder>/releases/<timestamp>/<project files>

For example:

/var/www/folksemantic/
/var/www/folksemantic/shared/
/var/www/folksemantic/current/
/var/www/folksemantic/current/app/ (and so on)
/var/www/folksemantic/releases/200805032003
/var/www/folksemantic/releases/200805032003/app (and so on)

<containing folder>/shared
This is where shared files that aren't replaced each time you deploy. For example config/global_config.yml and config/initializers/mail.rb As part of deploying an application, Capistrano sets up symbolic links from these files to the locations where they need to appear underneath the current folder where the application is run from.

<containing folder>/current
This is a symbolic link to a specific release folder (e.g. /var/www/ozmozr/releases/200805032003)

For more information on Capistrano see the Capistrano project website[http://www.capify.org/].


=== Diagnose and fix problems on the server
If Folksemantic doesn't start up, you can tail the production.log to see if it provides any clues about what is happening.

tail -F logs/production.log

To verify that Folksemantic is running you can check to see that the Rails server is up and running. If it is mongrel:

sudo ps -ef|grep mongrel

You can also look at the processes:

top

Then press Ctrl+M to sort processes by how much memory they are using.


=== Restart mongrel
Sometimes you may need to restart mongrel. Go to the current folder and run:

  sudo mongrel_rails cluster::restart

To just stop or start mongrel:

  sudo mongrel_rails cluster::stop
  sudo mongrel_rails cluster::start

Of course if mongrel gets fiesty and won't shut down, there is always:

  sudo kill -9 <process id>

To find out the process id for mongrel, use:

  sudo ps -ef|grep mongrel
